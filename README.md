# FeatureSpace-InstanceSpaceAugmentation

For training the supervised model, we perform data augmentation in both instance space and feature space. The instance space augmentation for the supervised model consists of some image transformation based on our domain knowledge, as well as smart augmentation. 
On the other hand, we adopt Mixup as our feature space augmentaion for the supervised model. We intergate smart augmentation and Mixup in our system.
